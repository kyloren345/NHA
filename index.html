                    Most of the war tactics Napoleon employed were; his commandeering of his men and gaining respect
                    from them, his surprise attacks and deception, speed by living off the land, decisive action, divide
                    and conquer and innovative artillery tactics. These proved time and time again to aid him in
                    victories over the duration of the Napoleonic Wars.

                    The First Coalition took place during 1792 and 1797 and this was the first time where Napoleon would
                    lead an army into battle. As part the Continental System that Napoleon employed, France blocked off
                    trade with Britain.

                  During the Second Coalition Napoleon reformed the government system. He scaled back rights for certain
                  groups - e.g women - but he was more fair towards other groups - e.g jews. He made the education
                  system better and made opportunities based on education/talent not heritage/nobility. However, a
                  portion of France's population demanded the return of the Church and revolted. After this revolution,
                  Napoleon brought back the Church but restricted its power. "Overall, Napoleon's aim was to end the
                  chaos of the revolution- and finally create a stable and prospering French Republic. And in that aim,
                  he seemed to be largely successful."

                    In the span of the Third Coaltion, Napoleon unveiled the reason as to why he was able to move so
                    quickly and surprise his enemies. This was the creation of The Corp system, essentially what this
                    system entailed was the use of living off the land gaining food and other resources. This meant that
                    Napoleon didn't have to take his supply trains with him, meaning that he could travel much faster as
                    everyone of his men is either on foot or on horse not having to pull the trains.

                  The Fourth Coalition started off with the battle of Eylau which brought blizzard conditions many men
                  from the Frech side either froze to death or were killed in combat due to the harsh weather conditions
                  they hadn't expected. The Russian artillery severely outmatched the French and Napoleon himself was
                  momentarily under risk of being captured. In the end, the French were brought to victory by a cavalry
                  charge conducted by Napoleon's flamboyant cavalry commander, Murat. During the Battle of Friedland,
                  Russian commander Bennigsen made a blunder, by positioning his men with their backs toward the river
                  Aloe. This allowed Napoleon's men to fire artillery at the Russians and pin them against the river and
                  gunfire.

                  In just four months Napoleon defeated Austria during the Fifth Coalition. The Austrians had been
                  watching Napoleon and learning, and they had made some reformations to their tactics. In addition to
                  this, Napoleon also had to rely on inexperienced conscripts after years of war. Around the same time,
                  the Swedish people overthrew their old king leading to Bernadotte becoming King of Sweden.

                  In the Sixth Coalition this is where Napoleon was finally defeated. It was between France and Russia
                  mainly as Russia turned their backs on the Continental System and started trade with Britain again.
                  This is where Napoleon declared war on Russia. He brought 650,000 men from all across his territory
                  and assembled them with the intention of defeating Russia however, things didn't go as planned. Russia
                  started retreating at the first contact with France and scorched the Earth as they went. This meant
                  that Napoleon "couldn't live off the land, and if he couldn't live off the land, then he would need
                  his supply trains, and if he needed his supply trains he couldn't travel as fast as he could" -
                  Oversimplified. After a long period of chasing, Napoleon eventually made it to Moscow however winter
                  conditions were on the way meaning it would get stupidly cold and Napoleon's men weren't wearing the
                  correct winter clothing. Napoleon sent a letter to Alexander however, Alexander didn't reply to thie
                  letter leading to Napoleon staying in Moscow until the winter hit and it was too late as some of his
                  men froze to death.d
